# Current version assumption: clang-15/16/17.

# In clang-15+ various tests (at least unit_test, transport_test exercise-mode SHM-jemalloc-sub-mode) shows warnings
# of the type:
#   SUMMARY: ThreadSanitizer: data race .../src/include/jemalloc/internal/extent_inlines.h:285:17 in extent_...
# The extent_ function varies, but in all cases it's in a subtree of a `je_arena*()` call; this is inside
# jemalloc.  I (ygoldfel) have filed a ticket regarding confirming this (as on the topic of SHM-jemalloc I am not
# the #1 subject matter expert), but IMO: this is very low-level code in the guts of jemalloc, and jemalloc is
# generally safe w/r/t concurrent calls; so most likely TSAN cannot follow what is going on.  Also similar
# warnings are observed in unit_test (and a colleague suppressed je_arena* for it similarly).  So:
# probably it is a false positive; but ticket has been filed to confirm; in the meantime confidence in TSAN
# coverage (with these suppressions) is high (on my part at least).
